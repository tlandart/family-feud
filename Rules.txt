Select a .json file from "questions" to play a round (or import your own).

1. Face-Off
	- One player from each team (team A and B) goes face-to-face.
	- As the question is read, either player A or B may buzz in. Once they buzz in, the host should pause reading the quesiton. The team of the player who buzzed in should be selected by clicking on their name (A or B).
	- If the player guessed incorrectly, the other player may hear the rest of the question and guess.
	- We continue to alternate until one player gets an answer on the board. We then continue to the next stage for that player's team.
2. Guess
	- The host should go down the line, allowing each team member to answer sequentially.
	- If the team successfully guesses the entire board, the round ends and that team keeps the points.
	- If the team accrues three strikes, we continue to the next stage.
3. Steal
	- The other team has one chance to steal. They may confer briefly and guess once.
	- If their guess is on the board, they steal ALL points accrued for that round from the other team (including from the face-off and the points for the guess they just made).
	- If their guess is incorrect, the round ends and the original team keeps the points.
4. Round Over
